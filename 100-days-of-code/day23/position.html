        static:	Places	the	element	in	its	default	position	in	the	page	flow
        relative:	Offsets	the	element	from	its	default	position	with	respect	to	its
        parent	container	while	keeping	the	element	in	the	page	flow
        absolute:	Offsets	the	element	from	its	default	position	with	respect	to	its
        parent	(or	sometimes	an	earlier	ancestor)	container	while	removing	the
        element	from	the	page	flow
        fixed:	Offsets	the	element	from	its	default	position	with	respect	to	the
        browser	window	while	removing	the	element	from	the	page	flow
        Because	static	positioning	is	what	the	browser	does	by	default,	I	won't	say
        anything	more	about	it.	For	the	other	three	positioning	values	—	relative,
        absolute,	and	fixed	—	notice	that	each	one	offsets	the	element.	Where	do
        these	offsets	come	from?	From	the	following	CSS	properties:

    <div class="image-div">
