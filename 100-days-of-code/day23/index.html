        An awfully long time ago, an informal or humorous name used in place of
        a person's given name was said to be that person's <i>ekename</i>. The
        old word <i>eke</i> means "extra" or "additional", and it survives today
        in phrases such as "to eke out a living." Error or mishearing is a
        common source of new English words, and ekename gives us a good example
        of this strange-but-true process at work. Whenever someone would say the
        phrase "an ekename," there was always a good chance that some listener
        (who had never heard the word before) would think the person was
        actually saying "a nekename." In this case, that mistake happened often
        enuff that <i>ekename</i> turned <i>nekename</i>, which then turned into
        our word <i>nickname</i>.

        <b>Note:</b> Creating a new word by chopping off the initial letter or
        syllable of an existing word is called aphaeresis (which means "to take
        away"). This not-as-uncommon-as-you-might-think process was the source
        of words such as mend (a shortening of amend), spy (from espy), cute
        (from acute), and squire (from esquire).
