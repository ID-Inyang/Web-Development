      <h3 class="daily-update">Day 0: Learning How the web works</h3>
      <p>
        Before getting started on the 100 days of code challenge, I had to send
        a couple days Learning about how the web works. How information travels
        from the web browser to the web server whenever we try to access
        something on the web.
      </p>
      <h3 class="daily-update">Day 1: Learning HTML Basics</h3>
      <p>
        I learnt about the most basic and common tags in html and I built a
        basic looking web page with an image and a link.
      </p>
      <h3 class="daily-update">Day 2: Learning CSS</h3>
      <p>
        I started out the day finishing up on learning the HTML basics and dived
        into learning CSS. I didn't do much on Day 2 but I got to understand the
        meaning of the name and how I can use it to style my web pages as a web
        developer.
      </p>
      <h3 class="daily-update">Day 3: Learning CSS 2</h3>
      <p>
        I learnt how to style text on my my web pages using different kinds of
        font styles and I also learnt how to work with colors on text
      </p>
      <h3 class="daily-update">Day 4: Learning CSS 3</h3>
      <p>
        Still learing CSS, I created a web page and applied background colors to
        the test and to the body of the page to make it look nice. I feel like I
        did a lot more learning of some CSS concept rather than learning too
        many new styles. concepts like selectors, styling hierarchy and some
        others.
      </p>
      <h3 class="daily-update">Day 5: Building an ugly webpage for Practice</h3>
      <p>
        As all <strong><em>Web developers</em></strong>  do, I continue to build web pages. I'm just
        realizing right now that a little planning ahead will do me a lot of
        good when it comes to projects.
